                    <h2>Distant View of Niagara Falls (1830)</h2> <br>
                    <h3><i>By Thomas Cole</i></h3> <br>
                    <p>Thomas Cole visited Niagara Falls in May 1829, composing this romanticized, autumnal scene the
                        following year. Portraying the grandeur of the American landscape, the artist omitted the
                        factories,
                        scenic overlooks, and hotels that populated the area in the early 19th century. Cole expressed
                        concern about the environmental impact of voracious industrialism, but at the same time his
                        painting
                        erased the human devastation wrought by colonialism and conquest in the region, which
                        encompassed
                        Attiwonderonk, Haudenosaunee, and Wenrohronon lands. The two Native American figures at center,
                        combined with the falls, identify the setting as North America, but their diminished presence in
                        scale and number reinforces the false idea of the “vanishing Indian” and is meant to signal
                        impending transformation rather than acknowledge their stolen sovereignty.</p>

                    <h2>The Travellers (1662)</h2> <br>
                    <h3><i>By Meindert Hobbema</i></h3> <br>
                    <p>Meindert Hobbema studied under the noted landscape artist Jacob van Ruisdael, and quite a few of
                        his compositions evolved from the work of his erstwhile master. The Travelers, one of Hobbema’s
                        largest works, is a close variant of a smaller painting of a watermill by Ruisdael now in the
                        Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.
                        <br><br>
                        Hobbema approached nature in a straightforward manner, depicting picturesque, rural scenery
                        enlivened by the presence of peasants or hunters. He often reused favorite motifs such as old
                        watermills, thatch-roofed cottages, and embanked dikes, rearranging them into new compositions.
                        Hobbema’s rolling clouds allow patches of sunshine to illuminate the rutted roads or small
                        streams that lead back into rustic woods. </p>

                    <h3><i>By Joseph Vernet</i></h3> <br>
                    <p>Joseph Vernet (1714–1789) evolved a luminous landscape style inspired by the port cities of Italy
                        and the precedent of the painter Claude Lorrain (1600–1682). Vernet’s fame led to the imitation
                        of his compositions by many followers, such as Charles François Lacroix de Marseille (ca.
                        1700–ca. 1779) and Francesco Fidanza (1747–1819). The painter who created this seascape remains
                        unknown, but they have taken compositional components from works by Vernet that were engraved in
                        the 1770s.</p>

                    <h2>The Organ Rehearsal (1885)</h2> <br>
                    <h3><i>By Henry Lerolle</i></h3> <br>
                    <p>This is the most important painting by Lerolle, a friend and collector of such artists as Degas,
                        Denis, and Vuillard. Set in the choir loft of the church of Saint-François-Xavier in Paris, it
                        features members of Lerolle’s intimate circle, including his wife (bare-headed) and her sisters,
                        in fashionable matching hats; his brother-in-law, composer Ernest Chausson, plays the organ. The
                        painter himself gazes outward at left. Shown at the Salon of 1885, this picture triumphed the
                        next year in New York, in the first major Impressionism exhibition in America. One critic
                        recalled, "spectators … spoke low before it, as if waiting for … the voice of the singer to be
                        heard."</p>
