        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us many things, but one thing became increasingly obvious: places of
            interest need to become more accessible. Consider all of the museums that had to close their doors
            indefinitely during the pandemic - the art and collections unable to be viewed. Also, consider the
            symphonies and plays that had to postpone their performances. Suddenly, the world became bleaker and less
            creative.

            I am purposing a website that makes the arts more accessible for everyone everywhere through curated
            collections of art, music, and performances merged seamlessly together. It is also with this goal that I
            hope to elevate local artists. The arts are an important part of cultivating a creative life and through
            this website, I hope to plant the seeds to bring more creativity into the world.

            I talked to my my cousin/coworker who has an art degree and she advised that I make the site clean,
            minimal, and simple. In other words, don't distract from the art that is being displayed as it is the only
            thing that matters. If the art or artist does require a biography or description, she advised to find a way
            that made it so it didn't interfere with the art. All in all, she did say that it was a cool idea and that
            she is excited to see it when it is done. I also talked to my mother and friend about the project. Both of
            them said that the idea was interesting, but definitely niche. My mom also suggested working with an already
            established museum or art gallery to curate a collection.

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The audience I intend to reach are those who find a fascination with art, but may not have access to a
            museum. In general, this site wil be directed towards more mature audiences (i.e., college students,
            elderly, etc.). This site will especially be interesting and focused towards people interested in the arts
            and history. Within this site, people will be able to learn of and experience different mediums of art.
            Whether it be for personal or educational purposes, we will welcome you!</p> <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <i>Why will people come to your site?</i><br>

            People will visit my site because they are interested in viewing and learning about art. The homepage is
            where I will do what I can to retain the people who visit. This can be done by creating a visually stunning
            and interactive homepage that is easy to navigate and directs the user where they are wanting to go.
            <br><br>

            <i>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them? What types of activities will
                visitors want to complete on your site?</i> <br>

            On the homepage, users will be able to see who the featured artists are and any upcoming virtual/online
            events that they can participate in. The events may include things like art shows or educational
            livestreams. Users can also opt in for weekly emails informing them of the new events and upcoming featured
            artists. <br><br>

            <i>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</i><br>

            No information is necessary on this page as all the content will be free and open to the public; however, if
            the user would like to sign up for email updates, they will be prompted to do so. <br><br>

            <i>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the
                actions? </i><br>

            People will want to come to our site because we will feature unknown and obscure artists that have not been
            around for a while. (This will help our site because all of the art will be in the public domain.)
            Additionally, we will try to make our site as interactive as possible by hosting the live virtual/online
            events that we hope will draw a lot of people.<br><br>

        <h3>Gallery</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <i>Why will people come to this page? </i><br>

            The gallery will be where all the action is. The gallery will display featured artists and art pieces –
            ranging from paintings, photography, music, etc.<br><br>

            <i>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</i><br>

            Users will be able to learn of the artist and the art piece – context, meaning, history, and the
            medium.<br><br>

            <i>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</i><br>

            Users will be able to interact with the site by viewing and learning about works of art, their artists, and
            the history surrounding the specific piece of art.<br><br>

            If possible (given my current skillset), I will try to let users filter and sort the art pieces and artist,
            so that they can study what they would prefer.<br><br>

            <i>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</i><br>

            No information is necessary on this page as all the content will be free and open to the public.<br><br>

        <h3>Shop</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <i>Why will people come to your site?</i><br>

            People will shop on my site because all the art shown on our site will be able to be bought as an
            art print. They can collect art prints and decorate their homes. They can also order art prints as gifts.
            All the art that will be offered on our site will be public domain (free for commercial use) and all profits
            will go to benefitting art programs around the world.<br><br>

            <i>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</i><br>

            The user will want to know pricing, sizes, material, and shipping times for their order. They will also want
            to know the art piece title, artist name, and if it is of a limited quantity.<br><br>

            <i>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</i><br>

            The user will need to specify what they want to order and how much to order. I am not sure if I can mockup
            an actual order processing page, but I will also need their address, email, and payment method.<br><br>
